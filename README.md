# üè´ School Management System
A feature-rich school management backend powered by GraphQL and Express.
This project was designed and implemented from the ground up, featuring a custom clean-code architecture for the GraphQL portion to ensure maintainability and scalability.
It leverages the power of GraphQL for flexible data querying while using Express.js for middleware and server setup.

## Key Features:

* Academic Management: Manage classes, teachers, students, homework assignments, and exams.
* Student Tracking: Monitor daily activities, including absences, positive points, and penalties.
* GraphQL API: A flexible and efficient API allowing clients to request exactly the data they need.
* Administrative Functions: Includes systems for payment processing and JWT-based user authentication.

## Tech Stack:

* Backend: Node.js, Express.js
* API Layer: GraphQL, Apollo Server, Express
* Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
* Authentication: JWT
